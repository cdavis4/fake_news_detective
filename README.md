#### _Fake News Detection Application_

Team Members: _Carrie Davis, Joseph Goodwin, Nicholas Schaffner, Lachlan Sinclair_ 

Goal is to learn the Software Development Life Cycle process using Waterfall and then Agile Methods by practice implementation. Our group was assigned the task of creating a Fake News Detection Application to educate users on the legitimacy of online news. This Github site contains related code and data. Including links and information on our project plans.
